# Handy Conversion Script to get TIMIT in the form that [kur](https://github.com/deepgram/kur) expects!

Instructions:
* Place the conversion script in the /path-to-unzipped-dataset/timit/TIMIT folder just outside of TRAIN and TEST folders
* Put the new "timit_test" and "timit_train" folders in a tarball (separately)
* Point kur's speech.yaml file at the two new tarballs
